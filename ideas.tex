\begin{document}


\section{Rose Elective Recommendation}
\subsection*{Description}
A website that would take in classes users have taken and would recommend
electives to them given their ratings. This could help students who are new to
the school and who don't know a lot about whether or not they would enjoy some
of the classes that are more obscure.
\subsection*{The Good}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Could be useful to students that don't know what to take
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Potential Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Would have to collect a lot of data to make this useful. We could find a
  different set of things to recommend to resolve this.
\item
  Would likely just tell students the obvious
\end{itemize}


\section{Org-mode Synchronization}
\subsection*{Description}
A website that, through some Elisp programming, would synchronize with Emacs
org mode. This could allow you to insert into your org files from a web browser
or, perhaps more importantly, from your phone. 
\subsection*{The Good}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Is something I could actually use
\item
  Would be fun to write some Elisp for the project
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Potential Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Has really already been done with Google calendar and Outlook
  synchronization.
\end{itemize}


\section{RxJS Simulator}
\subsection*{Description}
A website that simulates the streams of RxJS@\. A user could click buttons to
simulate events and change parameters to see how the final output stream
behaves
\subsection*{The Good}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hasn't been done as far as I know
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Potential Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Pretty niche
\end{itemize}
